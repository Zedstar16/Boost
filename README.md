# Boost
A plugin for boosting players, so making them move in whatever direction they face, at a speed determined by their level

- Boost levels, the max i would reccommend going to is 5, as any faster than that, and the server will revert movement.
- For understanding of boost levels, about 0.4 is player sprinting speed

# Commands
- /boost (level)  Boost yourself at chosen level
- /boost [off]  Disable boost for yourself
- /boost (player) (level)  Boost other players at specified level
- /boost (player) off  Turn off boost for specified player
- /boost help  Show boost help

# TODO
- Configuration for particles and how often the boost task runs
- Timelimit for boost, so a player can have boost for a certain amount of time
